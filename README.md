# Kernod [![Codacy Badge][codacy-link]][codacy-image]

A Q&A website for college students.



## Goals


1. **To build a helpful Q&A community.**

   I always wish I had an insightful and friendly community to browse and seek help from, especially when facing tricky problems. The purpose of the Kernod project is to built one. We'll bootstrap it by trying to attract knowledgeable individuals and make them stick around. Then, as long as the community keeps producing quality content and by doing so maintains a good reputation, new users will come and stay, so that the community can expand and evolve. Also, since new community members can learn a lot from the community, they'll eventually become sophisticated enough to contribute back, further pushing the community towards excellence.
   
   I would like to highlight that the heart of this project is the community itself, rather than a website, which is merely a supporting platform. Rivals can steal our idea, source code, or even development team, but they'll never snap up our user base.


2. **To establish an ever-growing knowledge base.**

   The Stack Exchange Network, one of our models, aims to "build libraries of high-quality questions and answers". Likewise, after years of dedicated operation, we would've hopefully collected tons of great content from the community, which composes a considerable "knowledge base". This is the integral of user contribution with respect to time, and a result of the intelligence of the community. 
   
   To make good use of the knowledge base, users are requested to search through the knowledge base before posting new questions, because these are very likely to be restatements of some well-answered questions posted a long time ago. For those who want to ask for help, this procedure provides easier access to inspiration (because you don't have to write up a new question and wait for responses), while for the lifesavers, this means fewer duplicates and thus a better answering experience.
   
    Note that the knowledge base is more than a byproduct. Instead, it's second only to the community in importance in my opinion.



## Slogan candidates

+ In knowledge we trust.
+ It's extraordinarily important that we in universities keep fun in learning. (inspired by the [foreword to SICP][sicp])
